#### Association Rules (AR)

Association Rules (AR) is a type of clustering algorithm. An association rule has two parts, an antecedent (if) and a consequent (then). An antecedent is an item found in the data. A consequent is an item that is found in combination with the antecedent. Association rules are created by analyzing data for frequent if/then patterns and using the criteria support and confidence to identify the most important relationships. *Support* is an indication of how frequently the items appear in the data. *Confidence* indicates the number of times the if/then statements have been found to be true.
In data mining, association rules are useful for analyzing and predicting customer behavior. They play an important part in shopping basket data analysis, product clustering, catalog design, store layout. In educational setting, AR can be used for `student profiling`.
